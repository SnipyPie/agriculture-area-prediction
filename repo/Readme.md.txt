# Agriculture Area Prediction

This project aims to predict the **Net Area Cultivated** based on various agricultural features such as **Net Area Sown**, **Area Under Current Fallows**, and **Uncultivated Area**. The project uses machine learning algorithms to predict and visualize agricultural land data.

## Features

- **Random Forest**: A regression model used to predict the net area cultivated.
- **Linear Regression**: A basic linear model to predict the same target.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Another powerful regression model for prediction.
